# Windows98
Windows98 created as accurately as possible using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Based off the works of https://github.com/lolstring/window98-html-css-js

This project is intended to test my abilities using modern Web Development technologies such as: HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.
I also intend to use the final product as my personal Web Devloper portfolio site, being it is that I was born in '98 I thought this would be a unique and creative way to express my personalitiy and competence as a developer.

I used the outstanding project created by https://github.com/lolstring as a general outline and starting point for this project. However, I found room for improvement in some areas and the possibilities endless for just how far I could extend the capabilities of the original project and recreate the actual Windows98 operating system as realistically as technically feasable. That being said, I also plan to make this entire recreation of a two-decade old operating system as a completely functional and mobile resposive web application.

Moving on into the future I hope that this project can be used in creating a framework that will allow me to recreate other versions of Windows operating systems, most likely Windows Vista and Windows 7, at least to start with.

I feel now I should take the time to apologize for the long-winded and unstructured nature of this text, my only excuse is that this is my very first project on GitHub, so hopefully I will figure things out quickly and learn the standards and best-practices of this platform.
